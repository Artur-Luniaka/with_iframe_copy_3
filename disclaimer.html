            <h2>Game Usage Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
              Gangsta Duel is built purely for entertainment. While it offers
              tactical combat and street-smart gameplay, we don’t guarantee any
              real-world skill improvement or strategic benefit outside the
              game.
            </p>

            <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
            <p>
              The content on this site is provided “as is.” We aim to keep all
              info current and correct, but make no promises that everything is
              always spot on or fully updated.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
            <p>
              Gangsta Duel may link to other websites or services. We're not
              responsible for what happens on those turf zones—check their
              policies before getting involved.
            </p>

            <h2>Game Performance</h2>
            <p>
              Performance might vary depending on your device, browser, and
              internet speed. For smooth duels, keep your system updated and use
              modern browsers.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              Gangsta Duel, its crew, and partners aren’t liable for any direct,
              indirect, or wild damages that might come from using our game or
              site. Play smart, play safe.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this disclaimer anytime. When we do, changes take
              effect the moment they're live here—so check back if needed.
